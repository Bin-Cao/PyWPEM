## Tutorial Overview

The tutorial includes several folders, each demonstrating specific functionalities of the PyXplore package:

* **basic_opt**: Demonstrates the basic operations involved in refinement.
* **multi_phases**: Introduces the process for refining multi-phase systems.
* **amorphous**: Provides a tutorial on analyzing amorphous signals.
* **simulation**: Illustrates the simulation features built into the package for refinement purposes.

  > Note: For general-purpose diffraction simulation, please refer to the standalone toolkit **Pysimxrd**.
* **atomic_dis**: Shows how to calculate atomic distances based on the radial distribution function derived from diffraction patterns.
* **solid_solution**: Demonstrates how to determine solid solution structures using powder XRD.
* **EXAFS**: Explains how PyXplore analyzes extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data.
* **XPS**: Describes how PyXplore processes X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data.
